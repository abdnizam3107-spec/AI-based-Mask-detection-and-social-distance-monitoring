# AI-based-Mask-detection-and-social-distance-monitoring
This project uses Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Computer Vision techniques to detect whether individuals are wearing face masks properly and maintaining safe social distance in real-time. It leverages TensorFlow, OpenCV, and deep learning models to process live video streams or recorded footage and provides instant feedback with visual indicators.

Key Features,
Face Mask Detection – Detects whether a person is wearing a mask, and highlights violations.
Social Distance Monitoring – Estimates the distance between individuals to ensure compliance with safety norms.
Real-Time Processing – Works with webcam or CCTV feeds for live monitoring.
Visual Alerts – Uses bounding boxes (green for safe, red for violation) with labels for clarity.
Scalable & Customizable – Can be adapted for workplaces, schools, hospitals, and public spaces.

Tech Stack
Programming Language: Python
Libraries: TensorFlow, Keras, OpenCV, NumPy, Matplotlib
Model: Pre-trained CNN for mask detection + distance estimation using object detection

Applications
Workplace safety monitoring
Hospitals and healthcare facilities
Schools, colleges, and universities
Public transport and crowded places
